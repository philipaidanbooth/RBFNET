# RBFNET

In my CS251 data visualization class, I created a single layer neural network to classify the MNIST digits. This project tested my foundational machine learning knowledge and was a good way to cap off my junior fall semester. 

Goals:
- Explore and implement a neural network for image classification.
- Gain experience with a real image dataset.
- Gain experience with setting up a supervised learning problem and analyzing the results.
- Revisit and review K-means clustering and linear regression.
- Practice working with Gaussian distributions (i.e. radial basis functions).
